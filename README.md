Developed a role-based Faculty Management System using C# and WinForms with raw SQL queries. The system supports faculty data management, workload assignment, room allocation, and project tracking. It features user authentication with three roles: Admin, Faculty Member, and Department Head. Employed object-oriented principles and connected the system to a normalized database  with features like request tracking and resource allocation.
